# DZ Woo Cart

### A WooCommerce plugin for Algerian Wilayas & Communes

**DZ Woo Cart** is a lightweight and essential WordPress plugin designed to enhance the WooCommerce checkout experience for e-commerce stores operating in Algeria. It extends the standard WooCommerce checkout form by adding a complete list of Algerian Wilayas (provinces) and a dynamic, accurate dropdown for Communes (cities).

This ensures that your customers can provide a precise and valid address, simplifying shipping, logistics, and delivery management.
